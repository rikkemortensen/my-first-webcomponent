# my-first-webcomponent

This projects demonstrates my limited experience with web components. 


The CardType component is created in the app.js file along with the styling. //
The style.css file contains a custom css variable, from where one can change the background-color of the card, the headline color and the color of the text area. The text area is a slot called main.
